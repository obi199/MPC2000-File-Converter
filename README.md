# MPC2000-File-Converter

Command Line Tool that converts 16bit 44100 Hz wave file (Mono/Stereo) to 16bit SND (MPC 2000) file or back. <br/>
Also you could use "convert_16bit" to convert any wav type to 16bit 44100 Mhz. Go to path and use filename or -f as argument for all files in folder. It adds 16bit_441Mhz to the new created filename. <br/> 
For SND conversion type: "wav2snd pathToFile" "snd2wav pathToFile". Tested with MPC 2000. <br/> 

Files can be compiled with Cmake:  wav2snd.cpp, snd2wav.cpp,  convert_16bit.cpp source files. <br/>
